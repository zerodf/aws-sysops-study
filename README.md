#### AWS Sysops Study

I want to have a public record of my study for the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate exam.  

So, I've created a respository of helpful snippets that will hopefully prove useful in my studies.  

##### Cloud Formation
[CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates will be used to build simple stacks for lab environments.  There should be some efficiency to be had there as CloudFormation is on the exam.  I will probably write most of these in JSON as JSON is the format used in the Official Study Guide.
