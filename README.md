#### AWS Sysops Study

I want to have a public record of my study for the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate exam.  

So, I've created a respository of helpful snippets that will hopefully prove useful in my studies.  

##### Cloud Formation
[CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates will be used to build simple stacks for lab environments.  There should be some efficiency to be had there as CloudFormation is on the exam.  I will probably write most of these in JSON as JSON is the format used in the Official Study Guide.   

CloudFormation templates will be saved in `/cloudformation`.

The initial goal with Cloudformation is to be able to rapidly spin up laboratory environments.  That will help with grinding [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2441632/zerodf) rep as well as prepping for the [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/) exam.

##### Scripting
Python is generally my development language of choice.  Why do I focus on Python?

Python is rapidly becoming the lingua franca of data science.  Additionally, Python is a popular middleware language.  Finally, Python is rapidly becoming the scripting language of choice for many technologists working on the infrastructure side.

##### Domains

As of 2019-12 the [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/) exam covers 7 domains.  In my lab preparations, I am going to work through them round robin fashion, linking code as appropriate.  

The domains are as follows:
* Domain 1: Monitoring and Reporting
* Domain 2: High Availability
* Domain 3: Deployment and Provisioning
* Domain 4: Storage and Data Management
* Domain 5: Security and Compliance
* Domain 6: Networking
* Domain 7: Automation and Optimization
